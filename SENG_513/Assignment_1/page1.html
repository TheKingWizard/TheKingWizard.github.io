                            The history of the Illuminati dates back millenia, all the way to time of the ancient Egyptians. It
                            was then and there that humanity first made contact with beings not of this world. Revered as gods, 
                            these extraterrestrials instructed the elite of the time to construct the Great Pyramids in their honour and 
                            were given power and riches in exchange for their servitude. These individuals went to great lengths to ensure that only they would reap
                            the rewards and made themselves the exclusive ambassadors to the otherworldy entities, forming a secret organization.
                            Over the ages this group has grown to eventually have dominion over the entire globe, and over time has become what is now
                            known as the Illuminati, taking the image of the pyramids from their origin as their symbol.
